    <description>Tynan says Rimworld is a storyteller, not a skill test. This mod is for people who want it to be both.

All raids now have the ability to breach assuming they contain any pawns with weapons enabled for breaching (will be configurable by mod settings soon. Current breach weapon keywords are "bomb, concussion, frag, rocket, inferno, blast, thermal, thump"). Please note this does not change the types of raiders that spawn, only adds breaching as an option to the raider decision making tree.

Raiders can also sap if they have no breachers. Raiders will no longer choose to enter your killbox if they can sap or breach instead. Raiders will also not beeline to colonists like they used to, they will attack colonists within LOS but if none available will focus on pillaging the colony.

Due to all of the above it is much harder to 'Game' the AI. Strategic defence of the whole colony and not just one entrance is very important.

Compatibility:

Can add/remove from save without issue.

Should be compatible with most mods unless they directly interfere with the breach and sap AI.

Walls are Solid: This mod will technically work with Walls are Solid but i have flagged as incompatible because the raiders aren't tweaked to handle the lower wall damage, meaning you will have a raider spend a very long time trying to sap your wall with his sniper rifle.

Combat Extended: Compatible, however a lot of tweaks were made to maintain performance, which included disabling some very old slow running CE code and fixing some CE side bugs with turret avoid grid generation. The side effect of the bonus performance is CE raiders tend to friendly fire more. You can choose to disable these tweaks in the mod options at your own risk.</description>
